# Which Java Tray
By Sarah Pierce
3/18/2018

Displays the current Java JDK version in the Windows tray.

Useful for keeping track of your environment when switching between JDK versions during development.

*Based on the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  I suggest you use %JAVA_HOME%\bin in your path, instead of the absolute path.*

To use:

* Download current release
* Run app
* JDK version will appear in Windows 10 tray
* Right-click tray icon for more options and to exit
